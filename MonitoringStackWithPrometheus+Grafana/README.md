# Docker Monitoring Stack: Prometheus + Grafana

This project provides a ready-to-use monitoring stack for Docker environments, using Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor, and Node Exporter. It allows you to monitor Docker containers and host metrics, visualize data in Grafana dashboards, and set up alerting rules.

## Key Concepts

- **Container Monitoring:** Track resource usage and health of Docker containers.
- **Metrics Visualization:** Use Grafana dashboards for real-time insights.
- **Alerting Rules:** Prometheus alerts on key metrics such as CPU usage or target downtime.

## Tools & Components

- **Prometheus:** Metrics collection and alerting engine
- **Grafana:** Visualization and dashboards
- **cAdvisor:** Exposes container resource usage and performance data
- **Node Exporter:** Collects host OS and hardware metrics
