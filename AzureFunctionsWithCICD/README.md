# Azure Functions in Docker with CI/CD

This project demonstrates how to build, containerize, and deploy a .NET Azure Functions app using Docker for portability and cost optimization. It features a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps and automates deployment to Azure Container Instances (ACI). The setup ensures serverless container hosting, easy distributed tracing, and efficient cost control.

## Key Concepts

- **Serverless Containers:** Run Azure Functions as Docker containers for environment consistency and portability.
- **Cost Optimization:** Use ACI for on-demand, pay-per-use compute.
- **CI/CD:** Automated builds, tests, and deployments with Azure DevOps.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Easily integrate Application Insights for tracing across distributed services.
